# bharath-intern-task-1
**STEP - 1:** 
import the set of libraries required for solving the problem\
**STEP - 2:** 
load the dataset file \
**STEP - 3:** 
create a scatterplot aand label for clear understanding\
**STEP - 4:**
creating 2 columns, in  one column we have all the column data except thr predicted output one and in the second column we have only the predicted column this is for making sure 2 columns are creted to fit the data \
**STEP - 5:** 
Create linear regression object and fit both the columns\
**STEP - 6:** 
to predict the output of the required house prediction value\

# bharath-intern-task-3
**STEP - 1:** 
import the set of libraries required for solving the problem\
**STEP - 2:** 
load the dataset file from sklearn.datsets \
**STEP - 3:** 
see the feature_names and target_names for clear understanding  
Here we can understand that  Sepal length vs Sepal Width (Setosa vs Versicolor) and Petal length vs Pepal Width (Setosa vs Versicolor) we need to plot so we need to 
assign the 3 target names to 3 different variables here df0,df1,df2
**STEP - 4:**
using tarin and testsplit model train the model 
**STEP - 5:** 
use KNN algorithm and then fit and predict
**STEP - 6:** 
make prediction on the new data by providing the sepal length , sepal width , petal length , petal width
